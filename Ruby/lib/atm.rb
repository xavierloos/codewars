# Buil a ATM machine that dispenses the correct denomination to the user

#Example
# If you request 110 dollars the second argument will ask for all the denomination the user wants and this will return a hash that has the denomitaions as the key and the value is the number of that denomination
# INPUT                      OUTPUT
# ATM(100,[100,20,10,5]) => {100 =>1,20=>0,10=>1,5=>0}
